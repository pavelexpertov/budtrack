The program's simple purpose is to track a budget limit for a given
topic (i.e. money for lunch).

These are the following features the program is supposed to do:

1. Be able to make a budget that can contain a set of topics and their
    limits.
2. Be able to create a topic (with a name) and make a budget limit.
3. Make the budget limit either a week or a month.
4. Be able to update an amount accumulated for that topic.
5. The program must allow users to make a given topic's leftover to
    be transferred to another week/month as an option.
