Made decision in: v0.1
date: 14/11/16

Context:
At the moment it seems that a request_processor module and
file_and_dir_operations (the relation to show that hasn't been drawn)
have an associative relationships with Budget class and it looks like
that it complicates the modules' dependencies. Therefore, I have decided
to make file_and_dir_operations module to have exclusive relationship
with the class and get rid of request_processor's relationship.
(The change is shown on Overview of Architectural Structrure.odg).
