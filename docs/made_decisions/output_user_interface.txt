Made decision in: v0.1
date: 03/11/16
OPTIONS:
1. Make budget's functions to perform output.
Pros:
- All related information is available at hand to generate appropriate
messages.
- No need for an extra module or making request_processor more cluttered
with output functions (which don't belong to it).
Cons:
- It makes internals exposed to certain functions (thus if change of
attributes might affect the output functions)
- Makes the class very cluttered with output function for each
operation. Thus it makes it less maintainable.

2. Make request_processor's operation functions (either using output
subfunctions or making operation ones do it themselves.)
Pros:
- Doesn't add an extra module or make Budget class with unrelated
functions.
Cons:
- Make request_processor cluttered with functions that doesn't belong
to cohesiveness of the module.

3. Make a separate module to contain output functions based on each
operation in request_processor.
Pros:
- Doesn't clutter both Budget class and request_processor module.
- Separates concerns well.
Cons:
- Adds an additional module, increasing file relation complexity.

DECISION FOR OUTPUT: 3. Separate module for having specialised output
functions.
